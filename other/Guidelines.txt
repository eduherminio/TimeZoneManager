Write an application that shows time in different timezones

* User must be able to create an account and log in.
* When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete timezones he entered.
* Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
* When a timezone is entered, each entry has a Name, Name of the city in timezone, the difference to GMT time.
* When displayed, each entry shows the current time in that timezone and the difference between the browser’s time.
* Filter by names.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication.
* In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
* If it’s a web application, it must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
* Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.
* Bonus: unit and e2e tests.
